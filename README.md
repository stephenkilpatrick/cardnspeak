# 1. Project Introduction
The purpose of this project is to create a RFID or NFC triggered device that plays audio files. The primary user of this project is young learners that need assistive technologies. Use case examples will be for literary education in which a learner could benefit from hearing words or phrases spoken aloud. Further uses could include communication devices for people who may have difficulty speaking.

# 2. Design
This project is designed with the intent that public schools with limited budget can duplicate the efforts with minimal expense or knowledge of technology.

# 3. Parts
* RFID reader - [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B7H6CQ2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - This RFID reader connects through USB and behaves like a keyboard. Whatever the ID of the card being scanned, it will be entered in as if typed.
* 125Khz RFID cards - [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M1L7NHI/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - The previously linked reader works with 125Khz RFID cards. Smaller RFID tags are available and would work well for embedding in small toys.
